# üì¶ Pockity

Pockity is a **secure, multi-tenant cloud storage service** that provides each user with isolated, quota-controlled storage inside a shared S3 bucket.  
Inspired by Doraemon's infinite pocket, Pockity aims to give developers a **scalable, API-first cloud storage solution** with flexible quota management and robust API key authentication.

## üîí Security & Data Isolation

Pockity ensures complete data isolation between users and API keys through several security measures:

### API Key-Based Isolation

- Each API key gets its own isolated folder: `apikeys/{accessKeyId}/`
- Automatic folder creation when API keys are approved
- Complete separation between different API keys, even from the same user
- Perfect for multi-application or multi-environment usage

### Storage Operation Security

- All storage operations validate ownership before allowing access
- Users/API keys cannot access files belonging to others
- Presigned URLs are generated with appropriate permissions
- Intelligent prefix routing based on authentication method

### API Key Security

- API keys use a two-part system: `accessKeyId` and `secretKey`
- Secret keys are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Keys can be revoked instantly and have activity tracking
- Each key has configurable quota permissions
- Automatic S3 folder provisioning ensures immediate isolation

### Admin Controls

- Admin-only endpoints for managing API key requests and approvals
- Comprehensive admin dashboard with system health monitoring
- User analytics and API key overview for administrators
- Real-time audit log monitoring with filtering capabilities
- Role-based middleware ensures only admins can access sensitive operations
- Comprehensive audit logging for all administrative actions

### Audit & Compliance

- Strict audit logging for all critical system events
- Automated logging of user registration, login, profile updates, deletions
- Complete API key lifecycle tracking (creation, usage, revocation)
- Email verification events and quota exceeded incidents
- Admin action logging with detailed metadata
- IP address and user agent tracking for security analysis

### Environment Security

- All AWS credentials and sensitive data stored in environment variables
- JWT tokens for secure authentication
- CORS protection with configurable origins

## üîß Core Concepts

### Quota Management

- Each API key has individual storage quotas (GB) and object count limits
- Quotas are requested by users and approved by admins
- Real-time quota checking before file uploads
- Usage tracking with percentage calculations
- Quota exceeded events are logged for monitoring

### Storage Isolation

- **API Key Storage:** `apikeys/{accessKeyId}/` - Complete isolation per API key
- Files uploaded with different authentication methods are completely isolated
- Automatic folder creation when API keys are approved

### Admin Approval Workflow

1. User requests API key with desired quotas and provides justification
2. Admin reviews the request and can approve/reject with comments
3. Upon approval, API key is generated and S3 folder is created
4. User receives access key ID and secret key for programmatic access
5. All actions are logged in audit trail

### Authentication Methods

- **JWT Authentication:** For user management, profile operations, API key requests
- **API Key Authentication:** For file storage operations only
- Each method provides access to different endpoints and isolated storage

---

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

- API key lifecycle (creation, usage, revocation)
- File operations (upload, download, delete)
- Admin actions and approvals

### Admin Dashboard

- System health monitoring
- User analytics and activity overview
- API key usage statistics
- Audit log analysis with filtering

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **Web Dashboard:** React/Next.js admin panel and user portal
- **Advanced Analytics:** Usage trends, growth metrics, cost analysis
- **Webhook System:** Real-time notifications for quota events and admin actions
- **CDN Integration:** CloudFront for faster file delivery
- **Backup & Recovery:** Automated backup strategies and disaster recovery
