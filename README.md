# üì¶ Pockity

Pockity is a **multi-tenant S3 storage orchestration server** that provides each user with secure and quota-controlled storage inside a shared S3 bucket.  
Inspired by Doraemon‚Äôs infinite pocket, Pockity aims to give developers a **scalable, API-first cloud storage solution** with flexible tiers, API key management, and crypto-friendly billing.

## üîí Security & Data Isolation

Pockity ensures complete data isolation between users through several security measures:

### User Storage Isolation
- Each user's files are stored under a unique prefix: `users/{userId}/`
- All storage operations validate user ownership before allowing access
- Users cannot access or manipulate files belonging to other users
- Presigned URLs are generated with user-specific permissions

### API Key Security
- API keys use a two-part system: `accessKeyId` and `secretKey`
- Secret keys are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Keys can be revoked instantly and have activity tracking
- Each key can optionally be tied to specific tier permissions

### Admin Controls
- Admin-only endpoints for managing tier requests and approvals
- Role-based middleware ensures only admins can access sensitive operations
- Audit logging for all administrative actions

### Environment Security
- All AWS credentials and sensitive data stored in environment variables
- JWT tokens for secure authentication
- CORS protection with configurable origins
