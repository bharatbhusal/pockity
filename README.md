# üì¶ Pockity

Pockity is a **multi-tenant S3 storage orchestration server** that provides each user with secure and quota-controlled storage inside a shared S3 bucket.  
Inspired by Doraemon‚Äôs infinite pocket, Pockity aims to give developers a **scalable, API-first cloud storage solution** with flexible tiers, API key management, and crypto-friendly billing.

## üîí Security & Data Isolation

Pockity ensures complete data isolation between users and API keys through several security measures:

### Dual-Mode Storage Isolation

#### API Key-Based Isolation
- Each API key gets its own isolated folder: `apikeys/{accessKeyId}/`
- Automatic folder creation when generating new API key pairs
- Complete separation between different API keys, even from the same user
- Perfect for multi-application or multi-environment usage

#### User-Based Isolation (Legacy Support)
- Traditional user folders: `users/{userId}/`
- Maintains backward compatibility with JWT authentication
- All existing user data remains accessible

### Storage Operation Security
- All storage operations validate ownership before allowing access
- Users/API keys cannot access files belonging to others
- Presigned URLs are generated with appropriate permissions
- Intelligent prefix routing based on authentication method

### API Key Security
- API keys use a two-part system: `accessKeyId` and `secretKey`
- Secret keys are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Keys can be revoked instantly and have activity tracking
- Each key can optionally be tied to specific tier permissions
- Automatic S3 folder provisioning ensures immediate isolation

### Admin Controls
- Admin-only endpoints for managing API key requests and approvals
- **NEW:** Comprehensive admin dashboard with system health monitoring
- **NEW:** User analytics and API key overview for administrators
- **NEW:** Real-time audit log monitoring with filtering capabilities
- Role-based middleware ensures only admins can access sensitive operations
- Comprehensive audit logging for all administrative actions

### Audit & Compliance
- **NEW:** Strict audit logging for all critical system events
- **NEW:** Automated logging of user registration, login, profile updates, deletions
- **NEW:** Complete API key lifecycle tracking (creation, usage, revocation)
- **NEW:** Email verification events and quota exceeded incidents
- **NEW:** Admin action logging with detailed metadata
- **NEW:** IP address and user agent tracking for security analysis

### Environment Security
- All AWS credentials and sensitive data stored in environment variables
- JWT tokens for secure authentication
- CORS protection with configurable origins
